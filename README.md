### Hi there 🦋 I'm Ruth Martínez,

I’m a software engineer student 👩‍💻 only a freshman so I’m trying to learn everything I’m able to 💻. I love to experience new things so I`m always up for traveling 🏞️
 


-  *Fun fact* I took me almost two years and many tries to complete Ocarina of Time, but It was worth it 🕹️
- The Secret Life of Waltter Mitty 💼✈️
 and Interestellar 🌌
 are life changing movies for me
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *C# and git*.

### My skills include
